Today, I've decided that I need to make something. A proper website. 

I've tired in the past but never had a good idea. I still don't have 
a good idea, so I'm not sure what I'm going to create yet. But I will
start creating something soon.

Although I do have my Atom packages to maintain, I want to try and 
build a website and maybe a web based App. It might be that I like 
that people are using something I've created, and as such is the 
drive to make something else. 

We'll see how it goes, and more importantly, if I have an idea...
